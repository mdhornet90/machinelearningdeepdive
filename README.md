# A Machine Learning Deepdive

I'm following along with the [deeplearning.ai Courses on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/info), but I'm worried that I won't learn enough by just filling in the blanks in a Jupyter Notebook.

To make sure I actually understand the fundamentals, I'll be creating iterations of the same Neural Network, first starting from scratch for all mathematical operations, and only after that will I incorporate Numpy to simplify the code and improve performance.

For the likely one other person who's ever seen my personal GitHub repo, you'll be able to follow along and see how the project evolves. I might also incorporate some kind of deployment tool learning at the same time so you can see performance metrics across the different versions, stuff like that. We'll seeeeee!


## Version 1
- Under the `v1` folder (duh)
- Intention is to craft all matrix data structures and any associated operations and equations by hand. I'll have to really grasp what the hell I've been flipping through on Coursera to see the same results when analyzing cat pictures.

## Journal

I like to take notes as I reason through programming exercises, so I'll keep a reverse chronological journal here.
