I have a lot of time to myself coming up, so this seems like the best opportunity I'm going to get to actually push myself to understand this.

This parity exercise isn't really working out how I want, and I can't tell if it's because I chose a bad problem or if I'm flubbing the basics, so I'm going to shift gears a little. Now I'm going to focus on addition of two numbers. Inputs will be a series of 2 x 1 integers, and the expected output will be their sum value. This should still be a nice easy problem that will give me a little more than straight parity determination.

Ok ok hang on, I'm going to simplify this further, since addition is multidimensional. What if I just doubled the number?
