Talked with my buddy Stuart who does this for a living, asked him some ultra-newb questions. I noticed that my quadratic equation wasn't working as I expected, and he pointed out that linear regression can't really express that concept because of the x^2 term. He also pointed me toward some good datasets to use for testing machine learning algorithms, so I think I'm going to use one of those, which is closer to a real world example without being as complicated as image recognition.

I think first I want to build some intuition visually so I can reasonably guess how my model is going to perform when I set it up mathematically
